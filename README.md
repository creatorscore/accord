# Accord

**The first verified, discreet platform for LGBTQ+ individuals seeking lavender marriages.**

---

## Overview

Accord is a native mobile dating application (iOS + Android) designed specifically for individuals seeking lavender marriages - marriages of convenience between LGBTQ+ individuals. The app provides advanced compatibility matching, end-to-end encrypted messaging, rigorous verification, and comprehensive privacy controls.

### Why Accord?

- **Privacy-First**: E2E encryption, photo blur, incognito mode
- **Safety & Verification**: Identity + video verification, block/report, content moderation
- **Purpose-Built**: Not a generic dating app - designed specifically for lavender marriages

### Target Market
