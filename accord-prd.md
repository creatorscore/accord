## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Supabase costs spiral due to high usage
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor daily costs via Supabase dashboard
- Set up billing alerts ($100, $500, $1000)
- Optimize queries (indexes, RLS policies)
- Implement rate limiting on expensive operations
- Cache frequently accessed data (profiles, matches)

**Risk:** Poor matching algorithm (low compatibility)
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test different weighting factors
- Collect user feedback ("Was this match good?")
- Iterate algorithm based on data
- Manual review of first 100 matches
- Allow users to adjust preferences

**Risk:** E2E encryption breaks messaging
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing before launch
- Fallback: Store keys in secure server-side vault
- Clear error messages for key loss
- Key recovery flow (re-authenticate)

**Risk:** Verification API downtime
**Mitigation:**
- Manual verification fallback (admin review)
- Queue system for pending verifications
- Status page for users
- Multiple provider options (Persona + Jumio)

### Business Risks

- Strategic paywall placement (after positive actions)
- Show value upfront ("See 12 people who liked you")

## FAQ (For Landing Page & App Store)

**Q: What is a lavender marriage?**
A: A lavender marriage is a marriage of convenience, typically between:
- Two LGBTQ+ individuals (e.g., gay man + lesbian woman)
- A straight woman and a gay man
Common reasons: financial stability, legal protections, companionship, escaping romantic/sexual expectations, or navigating social/family pressures.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes. Marriages between consenting adults are legal. We recommend consulting with a family law attorney and considering a prenup to clarify expectations.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Absolutely. We use end-to-end encryption for messages, never share your data, and offer privacy controls like photo blur and incognito mode.

**Q: How does verification work?**
A: We partner with Persona/Jumio for identity verification. You'll submit a photo of your ID and a video selfie. Verification typically takes 1-2 hours.

**Q: Can I stay anonymous?**
A: Yes. You can use a pseudonym, blur your photos until matched, and enable incognito mode to control visibility.

**Q: What if I change my mind?**
A: You can unmatch anyone at any time, block users, and delete your account with one tap.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Accord is free to use with basic features. Premium ($14.99/mo) and Platinum ($24.99/mo) unlock unlimited swipes, advanced features, and legal resources.
