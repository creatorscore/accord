# Accord Marketing Brief
## The Lavender Marriage App That Gives Zero F*cks About What They Think

---

## Brand Essence

**What We Are:**
The unapologetically queer dating app for finding your perfect fake spouse. We're here for the gays, lesbians, bis, and queers who are done playing straight for conservative families, oppressive governments, and nosy relatives.

**What We're Not:**
- A traditional dating app (we're better)
- Ashamed of what we do (lavender marriages are iconic)
- Corporate rainbow-washing (we're queer-owned, queer-operated, queer as f*ck)
